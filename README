 Written in PHP, Elemental is a mix of Objective and Old School PHP. It is mainly my take on a
 web framework. I made it to provide things I find useful, but I'm not making an promises on how
 you will take it. It started out of an annoyance with recreating bits of code for all my 
 projects, so I decided to create something reusable.

 Elemental offers a UI Management and User Authentication checks for loading applications and
 code execution, lots of great functions for manipulating data and to make data access easier.
 But I have to say that the UI Management is really one of its best features. I really hated
 all the current methods that CMSes provide for theming. They were always incomplete and hard
 to work with. So I tried to simplify it as much as possible, and then tacked on more complex
 features along the way.

 Basically all code is subject to change. I'm still working out the best way to do stuff. I
 wanted to try to make it innovative, yet not a pain or overly complex. As such, I may pull a
 Google and leave the BETA sticker on for an long period of time. Full documentation will be
 released before the final release, feel free to contact me early if you're interested.

 Put simply EVERYTHING HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!! Enjoy your stay.

 ==== License ============== Subject to Change =================================================

 Since I haven't really put much work into looking at liscense I don't really have one to put
 here. So I'll just make up some general rules (I mean, come on. Its not even done yet, is there
 even anything worth using yet!?).

 - Credit me somewhere
 - If you use full files leave the header in tact (<?php # Something [axiixc])
 - Realize that this is a work in progress, and don't expect me to answer all your questions
   ^ Not really a "terms of service" thing but hey, i need to put it somewhere
