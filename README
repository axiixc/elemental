 Written fully in PHP, Elemental EX provides the simplest get-going framework for web app
 development. It takes the common tasks of application development, user management and UI and
 does them for you, while leaving you enormous flexibility. 

 EX uses a bundle bases management system, where all code is bundled by its function. Executed
 code goes into application bundles and UI code goes into ui bundles. Everything is modular and
 easy to as drag and drop to install.

 Besides offering a expansive UI library, EX also makes data storage super easy with the Managed
 Data Library, which interfaces with special database tables to automatically store, edit and
 retrieve your data. These can be used with no SQL knowledge, however full MySQL access is still
 available, and extended through the MySQL::query() method, which gives you special syntax such
 as [prefix] and [database], as well as printf string support.
