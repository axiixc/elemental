 ==== License ============== Subject to Change =================================================

 Since I haven't really put much work into looking at liscense I don't really have one to put
 here. So I'll just make up some general rules (I mean, come on. Its not even done yet, is there
 even anything worth using yet!?).

 - Credit me somewhere
 - If you use full files leave the header in tact (<?php # Something [axiixc])
 - Realize that this is a work in progress, and don't expect me to answer all your questions
   ^ Not really a "terms of service" thing but hey, i need to put it somewhere
